I would like to free the world of disease. I believe that first step is to have data. I therefore seek to record the name of all germs, and their host, which may be human, animal, or plant.

sample data:
Norovirus, human
Salmonella, plant
Clostridium perfringens, human
Campylobacter, animal
Staphylococcus aureus, human

reports:
1) show me list of germs
2) show me count of germs per host
